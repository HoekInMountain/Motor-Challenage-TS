# Vehicle Management Application

## Description

This is a command-line application designed to manage various vehicle types. It allows users to create new vehicles or select from existing ones. Users can choose between three vehicle types: **Car**, **Truck**, and **Motorbike**. Once a vehicle is created or selected, users can perform different actions (like starting or stopping the vehicle) and see the results in the command-line interface. The application also allows users to perform multiple actions on a vehicle until they decide to exit.

The goal of this project is to expand the functionality of an existing application by adding support for additional vehicle types and enhancing the user experience.
